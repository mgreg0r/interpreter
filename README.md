# C-like language interpreter
This is a university assignment to create an interpreter of any custom programming language.

This language is based on well known C syntax, but it has some workarounds and simplifications to make the interpreter easier. Source codes of example programs can be found in `good_examples` and `bad_examples` (the latter are programs that result in error).

Compile with `make`
Run with  `./interpreter <path_to_source_file>`
